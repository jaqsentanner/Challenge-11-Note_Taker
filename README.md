# Note Taker Application - Express.js

## Description

This application serves as a simple note-taking tool that allows the user to enter notes to schedule/plan their day and keep track of the notes accordingly. The application is powered by Express.js / Node.js and will store data as a .json file.

## Adversity

During this challenge assignment I faced some difficulty getting the POST request to work when submitting data as a json object through insomnia. However, the application does seem to function when started with "node server.js" and used as intended. All notes save to db.json file accordingly. 

## Future_Development

I would like to continue troubleshooting why the POST request I was trying to use didn't work, and also add onto the project by accomplishing the BONUS task of adding a DELETE route.
